## CI/CD Pipeline
 
### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code every time changes are pushed to the repository.

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically integrates code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and runs tests to catch issues early.

**Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**: Automates the process of releasing changes to production or staging environments after passing all tests.

### Why They Are Important For The Project.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in the Airbnb Clone project provides several key benefits:

- **Faster development cycles** – Automates builds and testing

- **Improved code quality** – Runs tests and checks automatically with every commit

- **Early bug detection** – Catches issues before they reach production

- **Deployment confidence** – Ensures that only tested and verified code is deployed

### Recommended Tools

Here are some popular tools we may use to implement our CI/CD pipeline:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows directly from GitHub for testing, linting, and deployment.

- **Docker**: Provides consistent environments for development, testing, and production.

- **Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry**: Stores and shares Docker images.

- **Heroku / AWS / Render / Vercel**: Platforms for deploying the application.

- **Codecov / Coveralls**: Tracks test coverage as part of the CI process.
